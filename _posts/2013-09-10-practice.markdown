After a week of out-of-town vacation, I wasn't sure how I'd sound. Turns out muscle memory is better than I expected. Here's some of my practicing.

Dealing with Bach is like wrangling an aligator as usual. Still learning the last phrase before the middle.

THis is a long memorization practice section of Grieg's Wedding Day. I was hoping to get a really good take at the end and ended up practicing poorly. I'll never go for a take again. Ugh.

And finally, starting up some real Liszt practicing. I think Hungarian Rhapsodies are just in my hands. These chords come pretty easily to me, but still takes a while to just start recognizing one phrase.
