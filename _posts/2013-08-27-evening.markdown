Some more Bach, and a taste of how I'm practicing Mendelssohn Variations. This excerpt is variation 16, one that scares the begeezers out of me. After listening to it on Spotify, I realized that I was practicing it about 3x slower than it is at tempo, so my quick attempt to bring it up to speed and make sure my fingerings work.
