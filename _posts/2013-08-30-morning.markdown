I've been mesemerized by Wedding Day at Troldhaugen (Grieg) since I was a kid when a fellow student performed it gracefully. The piece has a lot more notes and dissonance than I had ever played before. I've since used it as a sight reading exercise, only now trying to perfect it. At this point, I'm in the middle of memorizing the A section and understanding the B section (it goes A-B-A coda).

As alluded in a previous post, I'm working on Mendelssohn Variations Serieuses. At this point, I can basically play through the entire piece, but still haven't figured out what I need to work on yet. This is a recording of the first five variations to investigate

Quickling realizing my phrasing is sucking in the first variation, here's my updating version, hopefully a little better
