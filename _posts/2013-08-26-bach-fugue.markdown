Bach Fugues have always been one of my nemeses. 4 voices is incredibly difficult to control with just 2 hands until you hear it, and 3 part is even worse on violin when you can really only play 2 strings easily. Well, here's the beginning... I've studied it for about a week now. We'll see how long it takes to get better.
