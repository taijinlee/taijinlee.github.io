I had about 30-40 minutes this morning to practice a little, so I concentrated on the first quarter of the piece. After working on the problem spots for a while, I ran through it a couple of times. Though each run through I'd stumble at a different place, it was the consistently those 2 particular passages. Now it's becoming more obvious what specific parts are much harder for my hands. Here are 2 of the better takes.

Now that I'm listening to them, I think I also need to work with a metronome and I obviously need to get a better recording setup too ...
