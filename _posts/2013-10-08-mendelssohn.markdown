I've started to memorize Mendelssohn as I clean up the harder variations. This is an exerpt of the first 4 variations and variation 16 that I've been trying to hammer out. I'm definitely spending too much time and energy into making golden recordings as opposed to just practicing, but I need to listen to myself, so I really need to just record longer periods and forget about mistakes. You can hear me reach for the music after struggling on the memorization on variation 3... haha
