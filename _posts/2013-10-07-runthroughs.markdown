I've been so busy with my new job and other random house work that I haven't had time to do much recording. I finally decided to record some runthroughs since I'm starting to need to listen to improve at this point.

Wedding Day (Greig), memorized:

{% include audioTags.html fileName="2013-10-07-grieg-runthrough" description="Grieg Runthrough 2013-10-07" %}

Bach Fugue, with music:

{% include audioTags.html fileName="2013-10-07-bach-fugue-runthrough" description="Bach Fugue Runthrough 2013-10-07" %}
